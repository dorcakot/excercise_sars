## Exercise 3: Working with count matrices (due date 11th May 2023)

In this exercise we want to run a differential gene expression analysis using an RNA-Seq count matrix (sample.counts). The sample metadata is available here: sample.info. Starting from an Rscript template please run a differential expression analysis, generate PCA, Heatmap and MA-plots and export the results into a CSV file. 
- all the analysis and graphs can be found in the analysis.Rmd/html file and the results are stored in the significant_results.csv

You may also want to run a gene set enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes.
- using Enrichr online suite, GSEA results using gese sets GO:BP and KEGG can be found in the png files
